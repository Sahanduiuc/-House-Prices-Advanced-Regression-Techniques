# House-Prices-Advanced-Regression-Techniques: How to score _ on the public leaderboard (top10%)

"Buying a house is a stressful thing."
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

# Metric
Submissions are evaluated on Root-Mean-Squared-Error (RMSE) between the logarithm of the predicted value and the logarithm of the observed sales price. (Taking logs means that errors in predicting expensive houses and cheap houses will affect the result equally.)

# Solution
In a form of a jupyter notebook, my solution goes through the basic steps of a data science pipeline:

Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
Data cleaning
Feature engineering
Modeling
Modelfine-tuning

Note that I have included a script with stacking for information only as it achive lower score.
